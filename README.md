# Bioinformatics Capstone Project

## Overview
This project is a reworking of previous code with significant optimizations, benchmarking, and speed improvements. The goal is to enhance the efficiency and scalability of the computational methods used in bioinformatics analysis. This repository contains updated implementations, performance comparisons, and detailed documentation of the improvements made.

## Features
- **Optimized Algorithms**: Improved computational efficiency for bioinformatics workflows.
- **Benchmarking Suite**: Tools to measure performance improvements against previous implementations.
- **Parallel Processing**: Leveraging multithreading/multiprocessing for speedups.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Refinements in algorithmic approaches to enhance results.
- **Code Refactoring**: Cleaning and structuring code for maintainability and readability.
